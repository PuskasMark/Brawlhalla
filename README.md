# Brawlhalla

## What's This About?

This is a simple static wepage, about one of my favourite games, Brawlhalla.
This webpage is also optimized for accessability standards.

## The Style
In this project I was meaning to showcase my creativity in design, creating an introduction to the game. 
I filled up the pages with colorful backgrounds and style elements for an engaging look.
The style is mainly achieved with the use of **Bootstrap**, with a little assist using **CSS**.
